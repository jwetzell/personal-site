## What is it?
GIDrone began as a part of my Master’s Project at Western Illinois University. The app came aboutduring talks with members of the GIS Center at WIU.

The function of the app is to facilitate flight missions done with drones for scenarios such as Search and Rescue. The first version of the app gave the user the ability to have a create “missions” and while flying have a similiar view to that of DJI’s iOS application. The difference being that at anytime during the flight the pilot could share the drone’s location, current image, and even entire mission flight log with the tap of a button. The user could also upload the flight as a Feautured Layer in ArcGIS online from the main screen of the app.

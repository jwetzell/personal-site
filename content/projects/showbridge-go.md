## What is it?
[Showbridge](https://github.com/jwetzell/showbridge-go) is a protocol "router" of sorts that allows the user to spin up "modules" and route messages between them with optional "processors" inline. The layout of the modules/processor registration is inspired by [caddy's](https://github.com/caddyserver/caddy/tree/master/modules) module system.

This is a re-imagination of a [previous project by the same name](https://github.com/jwetzell/showbridge).



Some of the technologies are listed below.

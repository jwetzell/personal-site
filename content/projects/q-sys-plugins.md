## What is it?
Through some side work I have started to mess with programming plugins for the Q-SYS ecosystem

These plugins are essentially a lua script with extensions provided by QSC that provide a framework for integrating into the Q-SYS ecosystem (inputs, outputs, network, etc.)

My first attempt at a proper plugin is for the NovaStar line of LED video wall controllers found [here](https://github.com/jwetzell/q-sys-plugin-novastar)

## Technologies Used

* Lua

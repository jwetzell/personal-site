## What is it?
Cue View is an Electron based application made by [Alec Sparks](https://alecsparks.com/Cue-View) for displaying information from various devices over the network.

I've worked on automating the build process and general clean up as well as testing the device integrations.

The application uses the following tech.

* [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/)
* [electron-builder](https://www.electron.build/) (package, publish, auto-update)
* [lodash](https://lodash.com/) (html templating)

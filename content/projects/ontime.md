## What is it?
Ontime is an NodeJS application bundled with Electron made by [Carlos Valente](https://carlosvalente.com/) which is described as a "browser-based application that manages event rundowns, scheduling, and cueing".

I've [worked on](https://github.com/cpvalente/ontime/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Ajwetzell+is%3Aclosed) automating some quality-of-life parts of the application like signed macOS builds, docker container, running headless, etc.

The application uses the following tech.

* [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/)
* [electron-builder](https://www.electron.build/) (package, publish)
* [React](https://react.dev/) (Web UI)
* [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) (Frontend Tooling)
* [pNpM](https://pnpm.io/) (Node package management)
